    <p>
    During the bowling season (middle of April to the middle of September) we play approximately 
    50 friendlies with local <a href="links.html#clubs">clubs</a> and provide some of the <em>possibly</em> best teas in the county!
    </p>

    <p>
    We are active in a number of local leagues and competitions including 
    <a href="http://www.aldershotanddistrict.co.uk/">The Aldershot &amp; District</a>,
    <a href="http://www.westsurreyba.org.uk/">West Surrey Bowling Association</a> 
    and Farnham Town. For a summary of our latest results see <a href="results.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    On Tuesday mornings at 10:00 a.m. and Thursday evenings from 6:30pm there is a club "roll up" to which all members are welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
    We hold regular free taster sessions for potential members, the only requirement being a pair of flat shoes
    to help protect our green. If you're interested why not e-mail us
